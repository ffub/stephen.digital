Costco have launched their travel offering in the UK market, where Costco stores are well known but Costco's travel offering is not. They wanted to understand the online research and purchasing behaviours in the UK and market differences between the UK and the US. Furthermore, they wanted to use this roll out to apply a new responsive design language to their site.

We ran research and design sprints, liaising with the team in Seattle and the UK team based in the UK to understand the market differences, identify a key problem area and prototype and validate solutions. I was project lead during the project.

## Discovery sprint

We travelled out to Seattle to meet the US travel team. We visited Costco's stores to see how travel was marketed in a retail environment, and ran workshops with key stakeholders from across the travel and IT teams to undersand their business requirements.

We then headed back to the UK, where we interviewed six users to get a feel for their shopping habits.

- Backwards and forwards between Seattle and UK
- Gruelling schedule
- Workshops in Seattle, followed by discovery research in the UK
- Short design sprint to focus on Car Rental

We dot-voted on the most promising ideas to take forward, and it was agreed to concentrate on the results page for the design sprint.

## Design sprint

Three promising approaches to the the results page came out of our sketching and we were able to quickly put together rough prototypes of them all within a day using Axure. We loosely adopted the responsive design language of a few pages they had designed, and were able to use Axure's repeater functionality, to add realistic data to each of the screens.

The Costco team were impressed by how quickly the sketches came to life, but we were unable as a group to agree on the best design to take forward. We therefore took all three variants into user testing, along with initial screens, as part of a complete flow.

## Outcome

The Costco Travel site has recently gone live, incorporating many of our findings and we are continuing to work with Costco.

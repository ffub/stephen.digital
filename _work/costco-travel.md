Costco have recently launched their travel offering in the UK market, initially focussing on car hire. Already knowledgeable about the US market, they wanted to understand online research and purchasing behaviours in the UK and how they differed from the US. Furthermore, they wanted to take this opportunity to apply a new responsive design language to their site.

[Webcredible][webc] ran research and design sprints, liaising with teams in Seattle and the UK to understand the market differences, identify a key problem area and prototype and validate solutions. I was project lead during the project.

## Discovery sprint

We travelled to Seattle to meet the US team and visit Costco first store, to see how travel was marketed in a retail environment. We ran workshops with key stakeholders from across the travel and IT teams to understand their business requirements.

We then headed back to the UK, where we interviewed users to get a feel for their shopping habits. We were interested in how they went about hiring a car for their holidays and what sort of research they did online. We also tested existing the existing, desktop-only car rental site from the US.

We dot-voted on the most promising ideas to take forward, and it was agreed to concentrate on the results page for the design sprint.

## Design sprint

Three promising approaches to the the results page came out of our sketching and we were able to quickly put together rough prototypes of them all within a day using Axure. We adopted the responsive design language of a few pages they had designed, and were able to use Axure's advanced repeater functionality, to add realistic data to each of the screens.

The Costco team were impressed by how quickly the sketches came to life and we were able to quickly form three strong hypotheses to take back to the UK.

## Outcome

The Costco Travel site has recently gone live, incorporating many of our findings. We are continuing to work with Costco to iterate and improve their car hire offering and deliver new travel verticals.

What On Earth Books is an independent publisher that produces Wallbooks, all-encompassing illustrated timelines of subjects as diverse as natural history, the complete works of Shakespeare and sport. I redesigned their site to increase sales, refocus the content and improve brand awareness.

## User Research

I started with a set of user interviews to understand the needs of What On Earth’s customers: parents, teachers and home educators. I was particularly keen to hear how they kept their children stimulated, discovered new resources and decorated their learning environments. From these interviews I developed a set of personas – archetypes that bring to life the site’s visitors.

## Information Architecture

The most obvious thing the previous site needed was a thorough reorganisation. I created a content inventory to get a picture of everything the current site covered. We tested the site with a few teachers to uncover the shortcomings and rated content on its usefulness, accuracy and find-ability.

A lack of consistent navigation meant that a lot of pages were not discoverable.

To target teachers we created a new database of teaching resources, which had previously been spread across the site. The blog was reorganised into new categories where much of the timely content that had previously been pages could now go.

We tested out a number of different labelling schemes with Optimal Workshop's excellent <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack">Treejack</a> product.

## Design

We split the project into a number of sprints to complete the design, working through the four main channels.  

### Exploration

For each channel I began by sketching the experience for mobile.

### Wireframes

I then created wireframes linked together with InvisionApp which gave us a working prototype of each section of the site.

## Illustrations

I worked with Andy Forshaw, the illustrator at What On Earth Books, to create bespoke illustrations for the website. We used monochrome illustrations to explain the format of the books and brought out characters from the books to illustrate features and topics.

## Bringing it all together

Once we were happy with these wireframes, we developed further wireframes for desktop. The advantage of such a comprehensive wireframing stage, combined with a modular approach to the design and CSS, was that we only needed to design high fidelity mockups for landing pages and components.

## Clearer communication

The existing site sent out emails for new orders, dispatch and refunds. These emails were text-heavy and visually identical. Customers complained that they had received two order confirmations prompting them to wonder if they had been charged twice, when in fact the second email was the dispatch notice. To make things clearer we gave each email a different header and clear subject lines.

## The results

Sales revenue has tripled over the last quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year and the website has had a lot of positive feedback from schools and parents alike.

Too much demand, not enough supply. That is the problem facing the NHS today and if you’ve ever been in an A&E, you will have felt the pain of waiting a few hours just to be seen. Naturally, they want to reduce the burden on it

Thats a lot of health apps, so the general public need some way to know which apps are good for them. After all, its their health that is at risk. So people will use whatever filtering options are available to them such as the app store reviews and app popularity categories.

Now, Public Health England, whose role it is to help protect and improve the nation’s health, reason that one way to help ease demand on the NHS is to encourage the public to self manage some of their own health through use of health apps. After all, many people in Britain own a mobile device. If you could all be encouraged to self manage your health with apps then that is potentially 80 people who may be spared a visit or two to the NHS.

Today, we’re going to talk about how we helped them meet this brief through designing a health app assessment service. Along the way, we will highlight which elements of our skill sets we’ve kept from our years working as a user experience agency and what new challenges we had to address to design a service. Hopefully, what you will find is that your still applying some of the same principles and skill-sets but on a bigger, potentially more complex scale.

I lead a project to bring Costco Travel to the UK, redesign their car rental booking flow to work across screen sizes and help them understand the market differences between their US and UK customers.

## The challenge

Costco have recently launched their travel offering in the UK market, initially focussing on car hire. They wanted to understand online research and purchasing behaviours in the UK and how they differed from the US. Furthermore, they wanted to take this opportunity to apply a new responsive design language to their site.

[Webcredible][webc] ran research and design sprints, liaising with teams in Seattle and the UK to understand the market differences, identify a key problem area and prototype and validate solutions. I lead the project, working with [Chris How][chris].

## Discovery sprint

Before jumping into design, we wanted to get a solid understanding of how UK customers hire cars as part of their holiday plans, how they shop for cars online and any pain points in the journey. We tested the existing Costco Travel US car rental site, which was desktop-only, to see how it compared to typical UK rental sites.

One of the most interesting findings was that all the participants were extremely image-led. They would enter some basic criteria and scan the results for the car that looked like the best match for their needs. They knew what sort of car they were after and quickly judged a car by its boot, how many doors it had and how familiar it was to them. Filters for class, storage space and seating were largely ignored.

The pictured car is usually indicative on car rental sites — you buy the car by class and may not get the exact make and model shown. This didn't seem to faze participants. They chose the car by picture, and assumed it would be alright.

Costco's US site delivered results as a grid, known as their Low Price Finder. This was polarising. Users that understood the structure of the table were able to efficiently marry up the two dimensions — class and brand — to find the price point that suited them. But to some users, this was a confusing spreadsheet when they were expecting a list of cars with photos.

## Design sprint

In Seattle, we delivered our findings to the US team, and used them as the springboard for the design sprint. We were keen to see how we could optimise the funnel and align it with the process our UK customers go through.

In our workshops we explored ways of bringing the grid view to mobile, and explored alternatives that were more image-led. Three promising approaches came out of our sketching and we were able to quickly put together initial prototypes of them all within a day.

There prototypes adopted the responsive design language of the responsive pages on Costco's US site and used Axure's advanced repeater functionality to add realistic data to each of the screens.

The Costco team were impressed by how quickly the sketches came to life. We further iterated our designs before heading back to the UK to test them out with users.

## Outcome

The Costco Travel UK site has recently gone live, incorporating many of our findings. We are continuing to work with Costco to bring their travel offering to mobile and UK audiences.

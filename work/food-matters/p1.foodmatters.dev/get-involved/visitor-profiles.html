            <h2 id="food-scientist">Food Scientist</h2>
            
            <p>Being a food scientist in the food and drink industry involves me developing a wide range of products and making sure they are safe for consumers. I use scientific techniques to provide accurate nutritional information for food labelling and investigate ways to keep food fresh, safe and attractive. I also work to find ways of producing food more quickly and cheaply and most importantly test the safety and quality of food.</p>
            
            <h2 id="food-chemists">Food Chemists</h2>
            
            <p>Being a food chemist makes me responsible for performing research for the purpose of developing and improving foods and beverages. Testing is conducted using a variety of natural, as well as synthetic foods and materials, analysing a food’s sensory effects and testing. Additionally, I ensure that food and food products are compliant with the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other governing bodies.</p>
            
            <h2 id="food-engineer">Food Engineer</h2>
            
            <p>My responsibilities as a food engineer typically include designing techniques for food processing and packaging, researching ways to improve the existing methods of food preservation, creating new foods, providing support to food manufacturing companies; as well as dealing with any challenges related to food supply.
            I often work alongside experts from the agricultural and food processing industries to improve food value, nutrition and supply. Mixing science and food also makes me responsible for developing new food items, or designing food production processes within a manufacturing company.</p>
            
            <h2 id="nutritionists">Nutritionists</h2>
            
            <p>My main call of duty is to carry out research and use scientific knowledge to provide information and advice about the effects of food and nutrition on health and wellbeing. As a nutritionist I work closely with dieticians and other health professionals such as pharmacists, GP’s and hospital or community diet and nutrition teams.
            In a typical week I can find myself working to make healthy food such as fruit and vegetables more easily available; raising awareness and educating colleagues in the health field about the benefits of healthy eating and the latest research. I tend to aim healthy eating campaigns at particular groups, such as young mothers or low income families.</p>
            
            <h2 id="director-of-public-health-and-healthcare-sector">Director of Public Health and Healthcare sector</h2>
            
            <p>I play a vital role in the health care industry, overseeing and making important decisions about health services. A general description of my role would be that I organise, plan, direct and manage public health care programs that are specific to counties and cities, ensuring that everyone within their sectors or departments are following federal health laws and regulations such as The Food Standards Act 1999.
            I also present and monitor the department’s budget, ensuring that the proper processes and resources are in place to respond to emergencies such as safety hazards and other health-related issues.</p>
            
            <h2 id="food-and-drink-marketing-design-agencies">Food and drink marketing/ design agencies</h2>
            
            <p>In 2001 we set up an agency so that we could focus on what we love most: the very best of eating and drinking. Driven by the diversity of our clients’ communications needs, we have grown over the last 11 years to become a full-service PR company.</p>
            
            <p>Our committed and talented team work closely with clients to plan and execute campaigns that capture the essence of their business, their products and communicate effectively to target customers. From luxury teas and innovative wine clubs to fabulous ethnic cafes and world- renowned restaurant brands, we help business communicate and promote themselves.</p>
            
            <p>When making purchasing decisions I must consider 4 crucial factors; customer demand, market trends, store policy and financial budgets. I also source new merchandise and review existing ones to ensure products remain competitive. Keeping up to date with market trends and reacting to changes in demand are key elements of the role – for example there is now much more focus on fair trade food and beverages.</p>
            
            <h2 id="contract-caterers">Contract caterers</h2>
            
            <p>My role involves providing food and drinks on a given set of terms of contract. The range of responsibilities involve delivery of meals, technical support and sometimes even full management of a restaurant. A critical part of my business is to ensure that all food procured and supplied meets the health laws and regulations.</p>
            
            <h2 id="packaging-designers-and-technologists">Packaging designers and technologists</h2>
            
            <p>As a packaging designer, I work with clients and creative teams to develop eye-catching, cost-effective and safe packaging for products. At the beginning of every design process I start off with a meeting with clients so that I can develop an understanding of their packaging needs. I can then assess consumer tastes, market trends and product detail to conceptualise package designs.
            The process continues until the client and myself are satisfied with the design. It is essential that I then create a prototype that can be analysed by clients and management. I then work with engineers, consumer safety groups and accountants to ensure that their prototype is safe and cost effective, before going into production.</p>
            
            <h2 id="packaging-technologist">Packaging Technologist</h2>
            
            <p>My main responsibility as a packaging technologist is to ensure that the packaging meets set requirements, specifications and regulation - for example fresh food Vs shelf food. This is undertaken by liaising with marketing, purchasing and production staff, whilst also checking that the packaging format is suitable by testing for performance under various conditions. I am also responsible for controlling production and quality standards, as well as identifying and choosing products from suppliers.</p>
